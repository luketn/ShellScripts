Shell Scripts
#############

These are the shell scripts I use on my Mac environments.

Shell scripts are stored in a Git synchronised directory and symbollically linked back to the user's home directory.
e.g. ln -s ~/ShellScripts/.mongorc.js ~/.mongorc.js

.mongorc.js
-----------
The mongo shell customizations are drawn from Tyler Brock's Mongo Hacker:

.bash_profile
-------------
The bash profile colorizes the ls output and adds the 'll' command.
